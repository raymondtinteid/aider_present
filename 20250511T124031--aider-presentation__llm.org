* Differences to other tools

- CLI tool
- open-source (python package)
- Can be used ~with any llm~ (i.e. local or provided)
- Simple tool, i.e. more control

* Benefits 🚀

- reads only codebase, can control which code is sent to gpt
- keep code private when running local models
- as CLI can be used in all IDEs
- transparent LLM costs
- optimize by splitting research/coding models
- ~readily available~

* Drawbacks 🤷

- other IDEs are easier to use
- CLI vs. GUI
- configuration needed

* IDE integration 🤖
In CLI via watch-mode

[[./aider_presentation/watch_file.png]]

Via Plugins:
- vs code
- vim
- emacs ⭐

*  Example: Aidermacs for emacs
:PROPERTIES:
:ORG-IMAGE-ACTUAL-WIDTH: 600
:END:

*  What I use aider for 🏇

- questions about objects
- refactor functions
- write unit tests
- write docstrings
- create examples for data classes
- plan things
- write git commits

* Different modes for either coding or questioning 🧵

1. */code mode:* default, make direct changes
2. */ask mode:* no code change
3. */architecture mode:* high level code discussion for planning/brainstorming

* Features I'd wished to have 🦾
- Documentation indexing
- MCP server integration
- +Autocompletion via tab+

* Advantages to RED/Azure Playground

- No copying of code into chat interface
- Automatic application of code changes
- Perform more complex refactoring code changes across files
- Programmable: agent to do tasks (file creation, git commits, etc.)

_In total more immersive, integrated workflow_

* Repository map of project as context 🗺

aider initializes a =repository map= of (git) repository have an understanding of the code base

* General tips for AI pair programming

- Add only necessary files to context
- Use type notations
- Use (data) classes
- Split code into smaller files/smaller functions
- Define conventions for consistency

https://aider.chat/docs/usage/tips.html

*Generally good coding practices apply*

* ... but also

- Don't blindly trust the AI
-

* Demo

- [ ] show in vs code with watch mode
- [ ] token/cost estimation
- [ ] make change with git commit
- [ ] revert change
- [ ] refactor function
- [ ] add docstring to function
- [ ] optional web interface
